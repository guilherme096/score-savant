## How to run the project:

This repository works only as an archive for the code. Since the database is hosted int IEETA's servers, it is not possible to have
access to the database without exposing the credentials. However, the code can be run locally but it will not be able to connect to the database.

**Note:** The docker must be running to run the project.

```bash
make buid
make run
```
